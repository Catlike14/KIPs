## Abstract

The next iteration of the coin contract proposes three main changes to enhance
the _maintainability_ and _security_ of the contract.

Firstly, the `rotate` function, which is responsible rotating an account guard in a contract that implements the `fungible-v2` interface,
will be removed. In the case of fungible tokens that also implement the `fungible-xchain` interface, this will result "correct by construction" cross-chain transactions by avoiding the risk of locking funds sent to the receiving account.

Secondly, the constants and some functions within the contract will be reorganized to
increase maintainability. This is intended to make the codebase more structured and easier
to maintain, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall quality of the contract.

Finally, verification related code of the coin contract will be modified to allow for
formal verification. This will enable rigorous proves of the contract's code to ensure
its correctness and reliability. By incorporating these changes, the new iteration of the
coin contract aims to provide a more secure and efficient platform for the exchange of
cryptocurrencies.

## Motivation

The presence of the `rotate` function in the current implementation of the contract undermines the
integrity of cross-chain transfers. Specifically, executing the rotate function before the
completion of a cross-chain transfer can result in the locking of funds.

Moreover, the utilization of our formal verification system can significantly enhance the
security of the contract. Therefore, necessary changes to allow the verification of the contract
are introduced.

## Timeline
The KIP process has a time constraint of *1.5 months*, which will end on June 30th AoE,
during which participants are expected to share their feedback.

## Rationale
Changes within `fungible-v3.pact`:
* Model annotation for the schema `account-details`: Add new invariant expressing positive
balance (`>= balance 0.0`).
* Model annotation for defun `get-balance`: Add new property that `!= account ""`
and `>= result 0.0`.
* Model annotation for defun `details`: Add property that the account is not empty `!= account ""`.
* Model annotation for defun `enforce-unit`: Add property that the amount is
not negative `>= amount 0.0`.
* Model annotation for defun `create-account`: Add property that the account is not
empty `!= account ""`.

Changes within `coin-v6.pact`:
* Change the `fungible-v2` interface to `fungible-v3`.
* Bless old coin contract (coin v5).
* Move constants (`COIN_CHARSET`, `MINIMUM_PRECISION`, `MINIMUM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH`,
`MAXIMUM_ACCOUNT_LENGTH`, and `VALID_CHAIN_IDS`) to a different section.
* Move utility functions (`enforce-unit`, and `validate-account`) to a different section.
* Replace `enforce (!= sender ...` by `validate-account` in defun `DEBIT` and `CREDIT`.
* Remove defcap `ROTATE`
* Add additional `enforce` to express that gas consumtion must be greater than
zero (`enforce (> total 0.0)`) within defun `redeem-gas`.
* Enforce the refund unit `enforce-unit refund` within defun `redeem-gas`.
* Add `validate-account` to defun `get-balance`.
* Add `validate-account` to defun `details`.
* Within `fund-tx` enforce a valid miner within the `defpact` step.
* Add invariant `>= balance 0.0` for the `allocation-schema`.
