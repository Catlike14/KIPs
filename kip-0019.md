## Abstract

The next iteration of the coin contract proposes two main changes to enhance
the _maintainability_ and _security_ of the contract.

Firstly, the `rotate` function, which is responsible rotating an account guard,
will be removed to preserve cross-chain soundness. This is to avoid the risk locking funds.

Secondly, the constants and some functions within the contract will be reorganized to
increase maintainability. This is intended to make the codebase more structured and easier
to maintain, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall quality of the contract.

Finally, verification related code of the coin contract will be modified to allow for
formal verification. This will enable rigorous proves of the contract's code to ensure
its correctness and reliability. By incorporating these changes, the new iteration of the
coin contract aims to provide a more secure and efficient platform for the exchange of
cryptocurrencies.

## Motivation

The presence of the `rotate` function in the current implementation of the contract undermines the
integrity of cross-chain transfers. Specifically, executing the rotate function before the
completion of a cross-chain transfer can result in the locking of funds.

Moreover, the utilization of our formal verification system can significantly enhance the
security of the contract. Therefore, necessary changes to allow the verification of the contract
are introduced.
