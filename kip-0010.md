Title: fungible-v2 Event Standard
Author: Stuart Popejoy stuart@kadena.io

Type: Standard
Category: Pact

## Abstract

This introduces the fungible token regression test script, which
acts as an "executable standard" for verifying token behavior.
In so doing, it also enforces the expected behavior of the
`TRANSFER` managed capability and event, so it is an
opportunity to document that behavior and specify new
requirements to enhance token balance tracking.

## Motivation

The token regression script was developed in early 2021 to test
a number of tokens in development, by capturing tests from `coin.repl`
in the Chainweb codebase and standardizing an approach that
would allow any token to be similarly regressed. As such it
also verifies the emission of `TRANSFER` events.

Events are a well-understood mechanism introduced by Ethereum, which
became part of Pact in version 3.6. The `fungible-v2` standard predates Pact events,
therefore events are not specified in the standard. This KIP
establishes the standard, and adds backward-compatible support
for burns/creates/crosschains.

## Backwards Compatibility

While `coin` does not directly implement the behaviors for burn/create
and gas events, Chainweb will be modified in version 3.8 to synthesize
them.

This also necessitates the ability to fire a managed capability as an
event with arbitrary parameters.

## Specification

See [fungible-v2.pact](kip-0005/fungible-v2.pact)
