## Abstract

Document the KIP process and ontology.

## Specification

KIPs describe an improvement to the Kadena Public ecosystem including Chainweb and Pact.

------

### KIP statuses

```
Draft ------+-> Final/Active --+-> Replaced
 | ^        |                  |
 | |        +-> Rejected       +-> Obsolete
 | |        |
Deferred    +-> Withdrawn
```

#### Draft
A new KIP, in PR or an accepted PR that is still being debated.

#### Deferred, Rejected, Withdrawn
Statuses that indicate a KIP has stopped, either for being too soon (Deferred), unacceptable (Rejected), or removed by the author (Withdrawn).

#### Final, Active
Final indicates KIP has successfully completed but not necessarily rolled-out.

Active indicates KIP does not need to be finalized (ie is an ongoing discussion, like this KIP).

#### Replaced, Obsolete

Indicators that a previously-final KIP has been superseded by a later KIP (Replaced) or no longer applies (Obsolete).

### KIP Types

#### Standard
A "standards track" KIP indicating some kind of concrete implementation with a specification.

#### Process
Describes a process, like this KIP.

#### Informational
Guidelines, general issues or information for the community.

-----

### KIP Categories

"Category" is borrowed from EIPs and corresponds to "Layer" in BIP
(see <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0123.mediawiki> regarding BIP layers).

Category is only for Standard types.

#### Chainweb (Soft or Hard Fork)
Core change to Chainweb consensus

#### P2P/Networking
Core change to Chainweb P2P or networking services

#### API
API/interface layer for interop/clients with Chainweb

#### Pact
Changes to the Pact smart contract language that particularly impact a protocol

#### Interfaces
Changes to or new interfaces in Pact to define smart contract interop.

### KIP Header

* kip: KIP-xxxx

* title: TBD by author

* author: Author(s) name and email addy.

* discussion: Optional URL of external discussion.

* status: See above

* type: See above

* category: See above

* created: create date YYYY-MM-DD

* requires: KIP number(s)

* replaces: KIP number(s)

* superseded-by: KIP number(s)

## KIP Sections:

This more or less copies the BIP section layout.

* Header: see above
* Abstract: <200 word summary.
* Specification: The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.
* Motivation: should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the KIP solves.
* Rationale: fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
* Backwards Compatibility: All KIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The KIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
* Reference Implementation: Ideally a reference implementation will precede acceptance/final status, but this depends on the nature of the improvement. If appropriate, code can be part of the KIP.
