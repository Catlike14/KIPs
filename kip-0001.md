## Abstract

Define and implement a Pact interface to provide a fungible coin or token standard, drawing inspiration
from ERC-20 and related token standards.


## Motivation

The outstanding motivation at time of writing is to ensure interoperability between the Kadena token,
as implemented in the "coin contract", and tokens that will exist on the system.

Otherwise, ERC-20 and related standards have proved their worth many times over. However Pact has
it's own way of doing things and `fungible` reflects that.

## Rationale

### Not including `totalSupply`
This can be specified in a separate interface, but for the coin contract, this is an expensive feature
that is unnecessary for runtime operation, and is better handled by off-chain market data.

### Decimal units
This fits with Pact's embrace of arbitrary-precision Decimal which is safe and expressive to use. However
there is no practical limit on precision, so this is an important specification for a token, and indeed
for the coin contract.

### No metadata
Things like `name`, `symbol` and other asset metadata are not relevant here.

### Cross-chain not specified
Cross-chain mobility, i.e. a `move` burn/create, requires a `defpact` which is not currently
supported in interfaces. A future version will support this.

### Managed TRANSFER capability not specified.
Managed capabilities allow for third-party--initiated transfers to be safe within the same transaction,
and eliminate the need for "on-behalf-of" in many cases. However `defcap` is not currently
supported in interfaces.

### On-behalf-of not specified.
As noted above, managed capabilities allow for safe inter-contract transfer within a single transaction.
This addresses one need of on-behalf-of in a single transaction.

The ability to lock up an amount for another party in a later transaction is not specified.
It nonetheless can be handled in a safe and effective way with custom `defpact`s which as noted
above are not supported in interfaces yet.

### Transfer restrictions not specified

Whitelisting/blacklisting and other security token standards are not specified.

### Schema for `details` not specified

Schema definition is not currently supported by interfaces.



## Backwards Compatibility

## Specification

See <kip-0001/fungible-v1.pact>.

### Fundamental operations

#### transfer

```
(defun transfer:string
  ( sender:string
    receiver:string
    amount:decimal
  )
  " Transfer AMOUNT between accounts SENDER and RECEIVER. \
  \ Fails if SENDER or RECEIVER accounts do not exist. \
  \ Subject to management by TRANSFER capability."
)
```

#### transfer-create

```
(defun transfer-create:string
  ( sender:string
    receiver:string
    receiver-guard:guard
    amount:decimal
  )
  " Transfer AMOUNT between accounts SENDER and RECEIVER. \
  \ Fails if SENDER does not exist. If RECEIVER exists, guard \
  \ must match existing value. If RECEIVER does not exist, \
  \ RECEIVER account is created using RECEIVER-GUARD. \
  \ Subject to management by TRANSFER capability."
)
```

#### balance, details

```
(defun balance:decimal
  ( account:string
  )
  " Get balance for ACCOUNT. Fails if account does not exist."
)

(defun details:object
  ( account: string
  )
  " Get an object with 'balance' and 'guard' values for ACCOUNT. \
  \ Fails if account does not exist."
)
```

#### precision, enforce-unit

```
(defun precision:integer
  ()
  "Return the maximum allowed decimal precision."
)

(defun enforce-unit:string
  ( amount:decimal
  )
  " Enforce minimum precision allowed for transactions."
)
```

#### create-account

```
(defun create-account:string
  ( account:string
    guard:guard
  )
  " Create ACCOUNT with 0.0 balance, with GUARD controlling access."
)
```

TODO: should `create-account` check the guard?

#### rotate

```
(defun rotate:string
  ( account:string
    new-guard:guard
  )
  " Rotate guard for ACCOUNT. Transaction is validated against \
  \ existing guard before installing new guard. "
)
```

TODO: should `rotate` check the new guard too?
