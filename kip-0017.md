# Motivation

This KIP proposes that the Kadena ecosystem implement the
[Wallet Connect v2 Sign API](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/api/sign). This
API allows for establishing a secure channel for communicating between dApps and
wallets in a platform-agnostic manner.

This is beneficial to Kadena for the following reasons:

- The Kadena ecosystem doesn't have a standard protocol for wallets and dApps to
  communicate with each other.
- Even if we had our own protocol, the Wallet Connect (WC) protocol is tried and
  tested across all devices and it removes the burden of having to maintain a
  kadena-specific implementation.
- Wallets and dApps that are already using the WC protocol will have an easier
  time integrating with the Kadena ecosystem.
- Kadena's previous Signing API required the wallet to be able to run an http
  server. This is not feasible for some browser-based and mobile wallets.

# Kadena's WalletConnect Specification

This specification is built on top of the
[WalletConnect Specification](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign).

## Pairing with WalletConnect

The dApp initiates a pairing with a wallet, using WalletConnect as a tunnel.
This is done by sending a so called
[Proposal](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#proposal).
This proposal contains the chains, methods and events the initiator wants to
utilize. The wallet responds with the
[Settlement](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#settlement).
This contains information on which of the requested items it supports.

### Example Pairing Proposal Request and Settlement Response

```jsonc
// Proposal request
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Proposal request
  "requiredNamespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "chains": ["kadena:mainnet01", "kadena:testnet04", "kadena:development"],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_get_accounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Settlement response
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Settlement response
  "namespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "accounts": [
        "kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:22ddc64851718e9d41d98b0f33d5e328ae5bbbbd97aed9885adac0f2d070ff9c"
      ],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_get_accounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

### WalletConnect Proposal request

WalletConnect dictates a `requiredNamespaces` property, that contains:

1. `requiredNamespaces`: `Object` 
   1.1. `chains`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Chain IDs](#kadena-chain-ids) 
   1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods) 
   1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events)

### Kadena Chain IDs

- Chain IDs are wallet-connect’s way of identifying specific blockchains within
  an ecosystem. They are defined by the
  [CAIP-2 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md),
  and are formatted as `namespace + ":" + reference`
- A reference refers to a specific network-id within the kadena ecosystem
- **NOTE**: Chain IDs in the wallet protocol ARE NOT the same as chainweb/pact’s
  version of “chain-id” — they are much more similar to `networkId`

These are valid kadena chain-ids

- `kadena:mainnet01` - Kadena mainnet
- `kadena:testnet04` - Current kadena testnet
- `kadena:development` - Kadena devnet


### WalletConnect Response

The response for the Proposal is an object that contains the following properties:


1. `namespaces`: `Object`
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Accounts](#accounts-1)
    1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods)
    1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events)

> **NB**: `accounts` is semantically specific to WalletConnect. This does not
> represent an account in Kadena. Read the motivation for this in
> [Accounts vs Public Keys](#accounts-vs-public-keys)

### `accounts`

The accounts property is an Array of
*[`WalletConnectAccountString`](#walletconnectaccountstring)*s

### WalletConnectAccountString

This is the description of an account provided by the wallet

A **WalletConnectAccountString** is build from
[`WalletConnectChainID`](#walletconnectchainid)`:`[`WalletConnectAccountAddress`](#walletconnectaccountaddress)

#### WalletConnectChainID

This is the description of the chain. It's build from
[`WalletConnectNamespace`](#walletconnectnamespace)`:`[`WalletConnectReference`](#walletconnectreference)

#### WalletConnectNamespace

The namespace for Kadena is `kadena`

#### WalletConnectReference

Is one of:

- `mainnet01`
- `testnet04`
- `development`

#### WalletConnectAccountAddress

This is the Kadena `publickey` that the wallet has access to. In some cases the
account belonging associated with the publickey in a fungible contract e.g.
`coin` can be derived from the publickey, in other cases to get the account to
use with this publickey the [`kadena_get_accounts_v1`](#kadena_get_accounts_v1)
method can be called.

## WalletConnect Methods

The methods available are:

- [`kadena_get_accounts_v1`](#kadena_get_accounts_v1)
- [`kadena_quicksign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1)
- [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1)

### kadena_get_accounts_v1

From the [Paring response](#pairing-with-walletconnect) an element from the
`accounts` property can be used to retrieve the available KadenaAccounts

#### Example kadena_get_accounts_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_get_accounts_v1 request
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account": "kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
      "contracts": ["coin"] // optional, when omitted, the wallet returns all accounts it knows of
    }
  ]
}
````

```jsonc
// kadena_get_accounts_v1 response
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account": "kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
      "pubkey": "38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
      "kadenaAccounts": [
        {
          "name": "w:aoriestnaoirsetnaorisetn",
          "contract": "coin",
          "chains": ["0", "1"]
        },
        {
          "name": "k:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
          "contract": "coin",
          "chains": [
            "0",
            "1",
            "2",
            "3",
            "4",
            "5",
            "6",
            "7",
            "8",
            "9",
            "10",
            "11",
            "12",
            "13",
            "14",
            "15",
            "16",
            "17",
            "18",
            "19"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Request Body

This method needs to be called with a body with the following properties:

- `accounts` an array of
  [WalletConnectAccountRequests](#WalletConnectAccountRequests)

##### WalletConnectAccountRequests

- `account`: a [WalletConnectAccountString](#walletconnectaccountstrings)
- `contracts`: **optional** an array of contracts for which the accountname is
  requested. If `contracts` is omitted, only the accounts that the wallet knows
  about will be returned

#### Response Body

The response contains the following properties

- `accounts` - an **Array** of [KadenaSigner](#kadenasigners)

> NB The accounts that are returned are the ones that are available in the scope
> of the wallet, so the accounts the wallet knows about.

##### KadenaSigner

An object with properties:

- `account` - a reference to the name of the requested
  [WalletConnectAccountString](#walletconnectaccountstring)
- `pubkey` - the corresponding public-key
- `kadenaAccounts` - an **Array** of [KadenaAccount](#kadenaaccount)

##### KadenaAccount

An object with properties

- `name` - the named account as stored in the blockchain for that specific
  contract
- `contract` - the contract that this account is used for
- `chains` - the chains on which this account is listed

> NB KadenaAccounts for several contracts, e.g. `coin` and `my-fungible` are
> seperate entries as the chains on which they are deployed can differ.

### kadena_quicksign_v1

#### Example kadena_quicksign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// Signing request
{
  "commandSigDatas": [CommandSigData]
}
```

The structure of `CommandSigData` is defined in the
[kip-0015 quicksign signing api v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#commandsigdata)

```jsonc
// Succesfull Signing response
{
  "responses": [Response]
}
```

or

```jsonc
// Failed Signing response
{
  "error": QuicksignError
}

```

The structure of `Response` and `QuicksignError` are defined in the
[kip-0015 quicksign signing api v1](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#quicksign-response)

### kadena_sign_v1

#### Example kadena_sign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// Signing request
{
  signingCmd
}

```

The structure of `signingCmd` is defined in the
[Chainweaver Signing Api](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang-api#chainweaver-signing-api-command)

```jsonc
# Signing response
{
  "signedCmd": {
      cmd: ...,
      hash: ...
      sigs: [
        ...
      ]
    }
}
```

# Rationale for the spec

## Namespace

- Namespaces are a way of identifying blockchain ecosystems in the
  wallet-connect protocol.
- In WC namespaces must abide by the
  [CAIP-2 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md)
  which imposes the following pattern-based restriction: `[-a-z0-9]{3,8}`
- The namespace for kadena is `kadena`

## Chain ID

- Chain IDs are wallet-connect’s way of identifying specific blockchains within
  an ecosystem. They are defined by the
  [CAIP-2 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md),
  and are formatted as `namespace + ":" + reference`
- A reference refers to a specific network-id within the kadena ecosystem
- **NOTE**: Chain IDs in the wallet protocol ARE NOT the same as chainweb/pact’s
  version of “chain-id” — they are much more similar to `networkId`

These are valid kadena chain-ids

```
# Kadena mainnet
kadena:mainnet01

# Current kadena testnet
kadena:testnet04

# Kadena devnet
kadena:development
```

## Accounts

- Accounts in wallet connect are used to specify control over signing privileges
- They must conform to
  [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md)
  and are formatted: `chain_id + ":" + account_address`
- **NOTE**: Wallet-connect’s `account_address` is NOT the same as pact’s coin
  account. Instead, they are analogous to pact’s `signer`
  ([see here](https://api.chainweb.com/openapi/pact.html#tag/model-payload))

### Accounts vs Public Keys

Several options were considered to include all the necessary information in the
initial pairing response, however various reasons forced us to only include
public keys.

1. KadenaAccounts have a maximum length of 256 where
   [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md)
   limits this to a maximum of 128 characters
2. We considered only addressing `k:` accounts, as they're build from
   `k`:`publicKey`, but we want this response to be generic for all accounts
   that could exist on the Kadena blockchain. Therefore we **strongly** advice
   against the use of the `publicKey` by just adding a `k:` in in front of this
   when working with KadenaAccounts. **Instead**, integrate the
   [`kadena_get_accounts_v1`](#kadena_get_accounts_v1) into the pairing process
   with the wallet, as this will allow for support of multi-sig accounts
   (`w:`-accounts) and other means of singing transactions

## WalletConnect Methods

- The supported methods are:

```
kadena_get_accounts_v1
kadena_sign_v1
kadena_quicksign_v1
```

## WalletConnect Events

- At the moment we see no need to standardize any events and believe that most
  usecases can be handled at the kadena-protocol level that sits atop wallet
  connect. This is subject to change in the future as we understand the
  workflows more through extended use of the protocol

## SLIP-0044

While not required in the namespace proposal process, a network's SLIP-0044
value is used throughout the WalletConnect demo code. Kadena's coin type is
**626** as documented in
https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md

# Backwards Compatibility

- The localhost:9467 will be phased out.
- The /sign and /quicksign will have their counterparts in WalletConnect Methods
  as [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1) and
  [`kadena_quicksign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1)
- Wallets that have the local webserver integrated, we suggest to keep this
  available behind a toggle, and transition to WalletConnect

TODO: document the considerations and incorporate the `NB`s from the spec

- We choose to not add chains to the
  [WalletConnectAccountRequests](#WalletConnectAccountRequests), since it would
  add complexity to the interface. The dApp can filter on the chains needed.
- Add rationale on why accounts are returned instead of public keys
