# Motivation

This KIP proposes that the Kadena ecosystem implement the
[Wallet Connect v2 Sign API](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/api/sign). This
API allows for establishing a secure channel for communicating between dApps and
wallets in a platform-agnostic manner.

This is beneficial to Kadena for the following reasons:

- The Kadena ecosystem doesn't have a standard protocol for wallets and dApps to
  communicate with each other.
- The Wallet Connect (WC) protocol is tried and
  tested across all devices and it removes the burden of having to maintain a
  kadena-specific implementation.
- Wallets and dApps that are already using the WC protocol will have an easier
  time integrating with the Kadena ecosystem.
- Kadena's previous Signing API required the wallet to be able to run an http
  server. This is not feasible for some browser-based and mobile wallets.

# Kadena's WalletConnect Specification

This specification is built on top of the
[WalletConnect Specification](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign).

## Pairing with WalletConnect

The dApp initiates a pairing with a wallet, using WalletConnect as a tunnel.
This is done by sending a so called
[Proposal](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#proposal).
This proposal contains the chains, methods and events the initiator wants to
utilize. The wallet responds with the
[Settlement](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#settlement).
This contains information on which of the requested items it supports.

### Example Pairing Proposal Request and Settlement Response

```jsonc
// Proposal Request
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Proposal request
  "requiredNamespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "chains": ["kadena:mainnet01", "kadena:testnet04", "kadena:development"],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_getAccounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Settlement Response
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Settlement response
  "namespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "accounts": [
        "kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:22ddc64851718e9d41d98b0f33d5e328ae5bbbbd97aed9885adac0f2d070ff9c"
      ],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_getAccounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

### WalletConnect Proposal Request

WalletConnect dictates a `requiredNamespaces` property that contains:

1. `requiredNamespaces`: `Object`\
    1.1. `chains`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Chain IDs](#wallet-connect-chain-ids) requested.\
    1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods) requested.\
    1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events) requested.

### WalletConnect Settlement Response

The response for the Proposal contains a `namespaces` object with the following properties:

1. `namespaces`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Accounts](#wallet-connect-accounts) availble for signing.\
    1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods) available.\
    1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events) available.

## Wallet Connect Chain IDs

Chain IDs are Wallet Connectâ€™s way of identifying specific blockchains within an ecosystem.

They are defined by the [CAIP-2 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md), and are formatted as:

```
    <namespace> + ":" + <reference>
```
- `<namespace>`: `string` - always defined as "kadena".
- `<reference>`: `string` - a unique network ID within the blockchain ecosystem (e.g. `testnet04`, `mainnet01`).

These are valid Chain IDs:

- `kadena:mainnet01` - Kadena mainnet
- `kadena:testnet04` - Current kadena testnet
- `kadena:development` - Kadena devnet

> **NB**: `Chain IDs`, as defined here, are semantically specific to
> WalletConnect and are not equivalent to Kadena's "chain IDs".
> They are more closely related to Kadena's `networkId` field.
> We are displaying Kadena `chainId` information (e.g. chain 1) in the [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1) method.


## Wallet Connect Accounts

Accounts are Wallet Connect's way of specifying control over signing priviledges.

They are defined by the [CAIP-10 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md), and are formatted as:
```
    <chain_id> + ":" + <account_address>
```
- `<chain_id>`: `string` - the Wallet Connect [Chain ID](#wallet-connect-chain-ids).
- `<account_address>`: `string` - the public key available for signing by the wallet.

> **NB**: `accounts` is semantically specific to WalletConnect. This does not
> represent an account in a Kadena fungible contract (e.g. `coin`).
> Read the motivation for this in [Accounts vs. Public Keys](#accounts-vs-public-keys).

Some users will want to know which account names in a Kadena fungible contract are associated with the public keys returned by Wallet Connect.

These users have two options:
- Some account names can be derived from the public key (e.g. `k:` accounts that are defined as `k:<public_key>`).
- For all other cases, the [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1)
method can be called.

## WalletConnect Methods

Wallet Connect methods are ways for dApps to interact with a wallet using predefined method identifiers and an optional payload.

The methods available for Kadena are:

- [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1)
- [`kadena_quickSign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1)
- [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1)

Any additional Kadena method names will be formatted as:
```
    kadena_<methodName>_v<methodVersionNumber>
```
- `<methodName>`: `string` - name of the method in camelCase format.
- `<methodVersionNumber>`: `integer` - the version number of the method.

> **NB**: All method names will be versioned to allow for facilitate future
> upgradability of the Wallet Connect method APIs.

### kadena_getAccounts_v1

This method returns the Kadena, fungible account names associated with a specific Wallet Connect account (a prefixed public key).

These Wallet Connect accounts are retrieved from the `accounts` property of a [Paring response](#pairing-with-walletconnect).

#### Example kadena_getAccounts_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_getAccounts_v1 Method Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",

        "contracts": ["coin"] // optional, when omitted, the wallet returns all known fungible accounts
      }
    ]
  }
}
````

                "19"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### kadena_getAccounts_v1 Request

This method needs to be called with a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    __ 1.1.1 `account`: `string` - the public key (a Wallet Connect [Account](#wallet-connect-accounts)) for which the Kadena account name is requested.\
    __ 1.1.2 `contracts`: `Array<string>` (optional) - array of fungible contracts for which the Kadena account name is requested. Returns all known Kadena accounts if omitted.

> **NB**: We choose to not add chains to the [getAccounts_v1](#kadena_getAccounts_v1-Request) Request, since it would
> add complexity to the interface. The dApp can filter on the chains needed.

#### kadena_getAccounts_v1 Response

The method response contains a `result` object that contains the following properties:

1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    __ 1.1.1 `account`: `string` - the Wallet Connect [Account](#wallet-connect-accounts) requested.\
    __ 1.1.2 `publicKey`: `string` - the public key extracted from the Wallet Connect account requested.\
    __ 1.1.3 `kadenaAccounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    ____ 1.1.3.1 `name`: `string` - the account name as stored in the blockchain for the specified contract.\
    ____ 1.1.3.2 `contract`: `string` - the contract that this account is used for.\
    ____ 1.1.3.3 `chains`: `Array<string>` - the chains on which this account is present.

> **NB**: The accounts that are returned are the ones that are available in the
> scope of the wallet (i.e. only the accounts the wallet knows about).

> **NB**: The same Kadena account name can be used in different contracts
> (e.g. `coin`, `my-fungible`). They require different entries
> since the chains on which the accounts are present can differ.



### kadena_quickSign_v1

QuickSign is part of the [Kadena Signing API](https://github.com/kadena-io/signing-api) and was defined in [kip-0015 (QuickSign Signing API v1)](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md).
This method allows the wallet to show the user multiple transactions that need signature approval.

#### Example kadena_quickSign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_quickSign_v1 Method Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_quickSign_v1",
  "params": {
    "commandSigDatas": [CommandSigData] // type defined in KIP-15
  }
}
````

```jsonc
// Successful kadena_quickSign_v1 Response
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result":  {
      "responses": [Response] // type defined in KIP-15
    }
}
```

or

```jsonc
// Failed kadena_quickSign_v1 Response
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result":  {
      "error": QuicksignError // type defined in KIP-15
    }
}

```

#### kadena_quickSign_v1 Request

This method needs to be called with a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object`\
    1.1. `commandSigDatas`: `Array<Object>` - A list of [`CommandSigData`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#commandsigdata) to sign.


#### kadena_quickSign_v1 Response

The method response contains a `result` object that contains the following properties if signing was successful:

1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `responses`: `Array<Object>` - A list of [`Response`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#response-1) containing the signed transactions.

If signing was NOT successful, then the `result` object contains the following properties:
1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `error`: `Object` - A list of [`QuicksignError`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#quicksignerror).

### kadena_sign_v1

Sign is part of the [Kadena Signing API](https://github.com/kadena-io/signing-api). This method allows the wallet to show the user a **single** transaction that needs signature approval.

#### Example kadena_sign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_sign_v1 Method Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_sign_v1",
  "params": {
    signingCmd // Chainweaver type
  }
}

```

```jsonc
// kadena_sign_v1 Response
{
  "signedCmd": {
      "cmd": "{\"networkId\":null,\"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":{\"accounts-admin-keyset\":[\"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d\"]},\"code\":\"(define-keyset 'k (read-keyset \\\"accounts-admin-keyset\\\"))\\n(module system 'k\\n  (defun get-system-time ()\\n    (time \\\"2017-10-31T12:00:00Z\\\")))\\n(get-system-time)\"}},\"signers\":[{\"pubKey\":\"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d\"}],\"meta\":{\"creationTime\":0,\"ttl\":0,\"gasLimit\":0,\"chainId\":\"\",\"gasPrice\":0,\"sender\":\"\"},\"nonce\":\"step01\"}",
      "hash": "kyrmaf0XJ5JDlsqoWDsdr9JpmugxRyIgsRm1ad4Fyc8",
      "sigs": [
        {
          "sig": "993e004f0c9d4627c75f8220b9c8b4e3e1e8eedfbd1a4983e5ff98b2d24196162e525b43703892b227c7582ec79e16b4fb32924a3f05c74c3feecc037becac05"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

#### kadena_sign_v1 Request

This method needs to be called with a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object` - A [`signingCmd`](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact-lang-api#chainweaver-signing-api-command) containing information the wallet needs to create and sign the transaction.

#### kadena_sign_v1 Response

The method response contains a `result` object that contains the following properties:

1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `signedCmd`: `Object` - A [`Pact Signed Command`](https://kadena-io.github.io/signing-api/#/definitions/Command) ready to be submitted to the blockchain.


## WalletConnect Events

At the moment we see no need to standardize any events and believe that most
use cases can be handled at the Kadena protocol level that sits atop Wallet
Connect.

This is subject to change in the future as we understand the workflows more through extended use of the protocol.

However, any future Kadena event names will be formatted as:
```
    kadena_<eventName>_v<eventVersionNumber>
```
- `<eventName>`: `string` - name of the event in camelCase format.
- `<eventVersionNumber>`: `integer` - the version number of the event.

> **NB**: All event names will be versioned to allow for facilitate future
> upgradability of the Wallet Connect events APIs.


# Rationale for the spec

## Accounts vs Public Keys

Several options were considered to include all the necessary information in the
initial pairing response, however various reasons forced us to only include
public keys.

1. KadenaAccounts have a maximum length of 256 where
   [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md)
   limits this to a maximum of 128 characters
2. We considered only addressing `k:` accounts, as they're build from
   `k`:`publicKey`, but we want this response to be generic for all accounts
   that could exist on the Kadena blockchain. Therefore we **strongly** advice
   against the use of the `publicKey` by just adding a `k:` in in front of this
   when working with KadenaAccounts. **Instead**, integrate the
   [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1) into the pairing process
   with the wallet, as this will allow for support of multi-sig accounts
   (`w:`-accounts) and other means of singing transactions

## SLIP-0044

While not required in the namespace proposal process, a network's SLIP-0044
value is used throughout the WalletConnect demo code.

Kadena's coin type is
**626** as documented in
https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md.

# Backwards Compatibility

- The `localhost:9467` web-server will be phased out.
- The `/sign` and `/quicksign` endpoints will have their counterparts in the WalletConnect Methods [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1) and [`kadena_quicksign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1).
- For wallets that have the local web-server integrated, we suggest they keep this available behind a toggle while they transition to WalletConnect.
